    <h1>The Greatest City on Earth</h1>

    <p>
        Lehi is undoubtably the greatest city in the world. The people here are wonderful.
        They are so willing to help others when they need it, and they go out of their way to be good neighbors. We also
        have lots of really good public facilities. The library is great, and the rec center has lots of fun things to
        do.
